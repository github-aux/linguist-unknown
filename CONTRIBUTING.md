### Reporting a bug

1. Look for any issues related to your bug [here](https://github.com/github-aux/linguist-unknown/issues).
2. If you find an issue that seems to be related, please comment there instead of creating a new issue. If at the end we determine to be a unique bug, we will let you know that a new issue can be created.
3. If you find no issue related to your bug, create a new issue by filling the [issues form](https://github.com/github-aux/linguist-unknown/issues/new).
If we find a related issue, we will reference it and close your issue, showing you where to follow the bug.
4. Tell us important details such as the webbrowser you are using.
5. Include any errors that may be displayed.
6. Update us if you have any new info, or if the problem resolves itself!

### Bug fixing or adding a new feature

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Our project uses the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Thus, it is a __must__ to read,  understand and write Airbnb-guide-compliant code.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
6. Submit a pull request in one of our [`dev` branches](#branches) :)
